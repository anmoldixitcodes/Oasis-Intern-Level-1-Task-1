            <p>As wikipedia says "The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that
                orbit it.It was formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed,
                forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc".</p>
            <p>The order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun and working outward is the
                following: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune</p>

            <div class="text">
                Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the smallest planet in the solar system — it is only a
                little larger than Earth's moon. Mercury zips around the sun in only 88 days and because it is so close
                to our star (about two-fifths the distance between Earth and the sun).

                Venus is the second planet from the sun and is the hottest planet in the solar system. Its thick
                atmosphere is extremely toxic and composed of sulfuric acid clouds, the planet is an extreme example of
                the greenhouse effect.

                Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the sun. It is a water world with two-thirds of the
                planet covered by water. Earth's atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen and it is the only world
                known to harbor life.

                Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is a cold, desert-like planet covered in iron oxide dust that
                gives the planet its signature red hue. Mars shares similarities with Earth: It is rocky, has mountains,
                valleys and canyons, and storm systems ranging from localized tornado-like dust devils to
                planet-engulfing dust storms.

                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest planet in the solar system. The gas giant is
                more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined, according to NASA.

                Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and is famous for its large and distinct ring system. Though
                Saturn is not the only planet in the solar system with rings.

                Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and is a bit of an oddball.

                It has clouds made of hydrogen sulfide, the same chemical that makes rotten eggs smell so foul. It
                rotates from east to west like Venus. But unlike Venus or any other planet, its equator is nearly at
                right angles to its orbit — it basically orbits on its side.

                Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun and is on average the coldest planet in the solar system. The

                degrees Celsius).
